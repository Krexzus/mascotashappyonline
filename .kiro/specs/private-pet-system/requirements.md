# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the current shared pet system into a private, user-specific pet management system similar to the Pou game. Each user will have their own private pet that only they can see, interact with, and modify. Other users cannot view or affect another user's pet, creating a personalized gaming experience where each player manages their own virtual pet independently.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to register and authenticate in the system, so that I can have my own private pet that only I can access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL create a unique user account with authentication credentials
2. WHEN a user logs in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and provide access to their private pet
3. WHEN a user logs in for the first time THEN the system SHALL automatically create a default pet for that user
4. IF a user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL reject the login attempt and return an authentication error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to have my own private pet that only I can see and interact with, so that my gaming experience is personal and independent from other players.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their pet THEN the system SHALL only show the pet belonging to that authenticated user
2. WHEN a user performs actions on their pet (feed, water, exercise) THEN the system SHALL only modify that user's pet data
3. WHEN a user requests pet status THEN the system SHALL only return information about their own pet
4. IF a user tries to access another user's pet THEN the system SHALL deny access and return an authorization error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want my pet's data to be completely isolated from other players, so that no other user can see or modify my pet's statistics, health, or customizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN retrieving pet data THEN the system SHALL filter results to only include the authenticated user's pet
2. WHEN updating pet statistics THEN the system SHALL only allow modifications to the authenticated user's pet
3. WHEN listing pets THEN the system SHALL only return the current user's pet, not other users' pets
4. IF an unauthorized access attempt occurs THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and deny access

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to customize and care for my pet independently, so that my choices and actions don't affect other players' pets and vice versa.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user feeds their pet THEN the system SHALL only increase hunger/happiness for that user's pet
2. WHEN a user customizes their pet with items THEN the system SHALL only apply changes to that user's pet
3. WHEN a user's pet gets sick or changes personality THEN the system SHALL only affect that specific user's pet
4. WHEN pet degradation occurs over time THEN the system SHALL apply degradation independently to each user's pet

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user authentication to be secure and reliable, so that user accounts and pet data remain protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing user passwords THEN the system SHALL hash passwords using a secure algorithm
2. WHEN generating authentication tokens THEN the system SHALL use secure, time-limited tokens
3. WHEN a user session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
4. IF multiple failed login attempts occur THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want my pet data to persist across sessions, so that my pet's progress is saved and continues even when I'm not actively playing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs out and logs back in THEN the system SHALL restore their pet's exact state from the last session
2. WHEN pet degradation occurs while user is offline THEN the system SHALL apply time-based degradation upon next login
3. WHEN a user hasn't logged in for extended periods THEN the system SHALL continue pet degradation based on elapsed time
4. IF database issues occur THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and prevent pet data corruption
